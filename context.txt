üß¨ GENERAL HEALTH

A balanced diet includes carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, and water in appropriate amounts. Regular physical activity supports cardiovascular, muscular, and mental health.

The normal human body temperature is around 98.6¬∞F (37¬∞C), though it can vary slightly.

üíì HEART & BLOOD

Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the arteries. A normal reading is around 120/80 mmHg.

High blood pressure (hypertension) increases the risk of heart attack and stroke. It is often asymptomatic and called the "silent killer".

A normal adult heart rate ranges from 60 to 100 beats per minute.

ü©∏ DIABETES

Diabetes is a condition that impairs the body's ability to process blood glucose.

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disorder typically diagnosed in childhood, while Type 2 diabetes is more common in adults and linked to lifestyle factors.

Symptoms of diabetes include excessive thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, and blurred vision.

ü¶¥ BONES & NUTRITION

The human skeleton has 206 bones. The femur is the longest bone; the stapes in the ear is the smallest.

Vitamin D helps absorb calcium for strong bones. It can be obtained from sunlight, fish, eggs, and fortified milk.

Iron helps make hemoglobin in red blood cells. Iron deficiency can cause anemia, resulting in fatigue and weakness.

üçΩÔ∏è DIGESTION

The digestive system breaks down food into nutrients. It includes the mouth, esophagus, stomach, intestines, liver, pancreas, and gallbladder.

Indigestion, gas, constipation, and diarrhea are common digestive issues. Drinking water, eating fiber, and regular meals can help prevent them.

ü¶† INFECTIOUS DISEASES

COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Symptoms include fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, and loss of smell or taste.

The flu is caused by the influenza virus. It spreads through droplets and typically causes fever, chills, and sore throat.

Vaccines prepare the immune system to fight diseases by introducing harmless components of a virus or bacteria.

üß† MENTAL HEALTH

Depression is a mood disorder marked by persistent sadness, loss of interest, and fatigue. It can be treated with therapy, medication, or both.

Anxiety involves excessive worry and can cause physical symptoms like rapid heartbeat and sweating.

Mental health is as important as physical health and should be regularly evaluated.

ü§ï COMMON SYMPTOMS

üß† HEADACHE

A headache is pain in any region of the head. It may occur on one or both sides, be isolated to a specific location, or radiate across the head.

Common types of headaches:
- Tension headache: dull, aching pain often due to stress or fatigue.
- Migraine: intense throbbing pain, often with nausea and sensitivity to light or sound.
- Cluster headache: severe pain around one eye, occurring in cycles.
- Sinus headache: pressure around eyes, cheeks, and forehead.

Treatment may include hydration, rest, and over-the-counter medications like paracetamol or ibuprofen.

Seek medical help if the headache is sudden, severe, or accompanied by confusion, vision problems, or fever.

üçΩÔ∏è STOMACH PAIN

Stomach pain (abdominal pain) can have many causes. It may be mild or severe, acute or chronic.

Common causes include:
- Indigestion: burning or discomfort after eating
- Gas: trapped air causing cramps or bloating
- Gastritis: inflammation of the stomach lining
- Food poisoning: vomiting or diarrhea from spoiled food
- Constipation: hard or infrequent bowel movements
- Appendicitis: sharp pain in lower right abdomen
- Menstrual cramps: lower abdominal pain during periods

Treatment depends on the cause. General advice includes resting, eating bland food, and drinking fluids.

Seek a doctor if pain is intense, persistent, or comes with vomiting, fever, or blood.

ü§ß COLD & ALLERGIES

The common cold is caused by viruses such as rhinovirus. Symptoms include sore throat, runny nose, coughing, sneezing, and mild fatigue.

Allergies occur when the immune system overreacts to harmless substances like pollen, dust, or food. Symptoms include sneezing, watery eyes, itching, and rashes.

Treatment includes rest, fluids, antihistamines (for allergies), and over-the-counter cold remedies.

Consult a doctor if symptoms last more than 10 days, worsen, or include shortness of breath.

üß¥ SKIN & HYGIENE

Acne is a common skin condition where pores become clogged with oil and dead skin, often during adolescence. Good hygiene, gentle cleansing, and avoiding picking help prevent it.

Eczema is a condition that causes itchy, inflamed skin. It may be triggered by allergens or irritants and is managed by moisturizers and sometimes corticosteroids.

Proper hygiene includes hand washing, bathing regularly, brushing teeth, and wearing clean clothes.

Fungal infections like athlete‚Äôs foot or ringworm are common and can be treated with antifungal creams.

üßí CHILDREN‚ÄôS HEALTH

Common childhood illnesses include colds, ear infections, chickenpox, and stomach bugs.

Vaccines help protect children from serious diseases like measles, polio, and hepatitis.

Good nutrition, sleep, and regular checkups support healthy development.

Watch for signs of dehydration, rash, or high fever in children and consult a pediatrician if symptoms are severe or persistent.

üöë EMERGENCY SYMPTOMS

Call emergency services immediately if someone has:
- Chest pain or pressure
- Difficulty breathing
- Seizure or sudden confusion
- Severe bleeding or injury
- Loss of consciousness
